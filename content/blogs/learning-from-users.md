We began this mission by providing Google Analytics 360 subscriptions, training
sessions, and [analytics.service.gov.au](https://analytics.service.gov.au),
however we wanted to understand better the realities of what being an Australian
Public Service analyst was like. We wanted to understand how our users’ worlds
worked, what their professional pain points were, and whether there were
opportunities to enhance their practice so they could deliver more value to
their organisations.

[Research](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-services/user-research)
started with analysts who subscribe to the
[Observatory](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/govau-observatory) and use our
services daily. We spoke with 18 users across 13 agencies during our first phase
of
[Discovery](https://www.dta.gov.au/help-and-advice/build-and-improve-services/service-design-and-delivery-process/discovery-stage-exploring-problem)
interviews. They told us about their experiences interacting with our service
and using analytics in their organisations.

## Developing our line of enquiry and conducting interviews

Our main aim is to empower data analysts across government, so we designed our
line of inquiry to match. We explored:

- how our users engaged with analytics in their day-to-day work
- what kinds of questions our users were trying to answer through analytics
- what barriers and opportunities our users saw in reaching their desired goals

We designed our interviews to be semi-structured — we followed a line of inquiry
but allowed participants to guide the conversation with the stories they wanted
to share. This approach allowed us to organically explore our research
objectives without leading conversations too strongly. This helped uncover new
and unexpected insights.

## Synthesising and analysing our findings

2 members of the Observatory team attended each interview with the analyst. We
then synthesised what we heard using a collaborative online whiteboard. We
captured key observations, quotes and ideas. The board became the space where we
could group and theme similar ideas that came out of all the interviews.

In user research we say, 'it only takes 1 person to notice the missing step on
the staircase'. Even if only 1 subscriber gave an insight, we treated it as
having analytical importance to make sure we heard our users.

Once we had themed our interview findings, we analysed themes together to see
what they told us about the user experience. This is how we uncovered insights.

## What we learned

In our
[Discovery Insights Report](../../gov-au-observatory_discovery_research_findings-report.pdf)
we capture the high-level findings – users’ experiences with analytics and
engaging with the current
[gov.au Observatory service](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/govau-observatory).

Our users We learned that we have primary and secondary users.

We assumed the research cohort was obvious, since our assumption was that data
analysts were our **primary users**. From our conversations we also learned
there were relevant stakeholders on the fringe of data analysts – those that
analysts reported to, or those needing data to explore or validate assumptions
and hypotheses.

Through our research with primary users, we understood that these **secondary
users** were also important to the Observatory’s mission as they represent the
end-users of analytics work. In future we aim to further research the
stakeholder experience to improve the focus of our work.

## Types of barriers our users face

Barriers for users include:

- culture
- technology
- visibility
- capability
- resources
- security
- relationships
- perception
- data literacy
- user perspective

These barriers occurred at different rates and in different forms across
agencies. They represent a challenge to our mission. By exploring them we will
better understand how to navigate the challenges faced by our users as they try
and improve agencies’ services.

The context of our primary users, including pain points and opportunities It can
be difficult for our users to establish an 'analytics service’ within their
organisation. This is due to the ad hoc nature of how they receive and answer
requests. A lack of awareness among stakeholders about the power of data led to
infrequent and less strategic use of data.

We also found that users would like to have a greater sense of purpose behind
the use of Google Analytics and know how to define and measure success. Some
also face barriers to adopting user-centred design principles, which impacts
their ability to work with Google Analytics.

## Responding to user needs

3 ways the Observatory can respond to user needs includes:

- analytics leadership through best practice guidelines, standards and advice
- the creation of practical tools and templates to support users which are
  aligned to best practice
- facilitation of sharing and learning relationships across government

A deeper exploration of these insights can be found in our
[Discovery Insights Report](../../gov-au-observatory_discovery_research_findings-report.pdf).

## Moving forward

We are beginning to refine, design, and test possible solutions.

We are adopting a
[dual-track agile](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/dual-track-development/)
approach to working. This means we will use a parallel Discovery process to
explore hypotheses and test prototypes. This will also improve our ability to
deliver viable solutions.
