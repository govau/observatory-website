  The Coronavirus pandemic can be described as a ‘mega disruption’, dramatically
  changing the way we all work and live. It also changed the way the community
  uses government services, especially the services that help Australians during
  a crisis.

With the upcoming
[refresh of the Digital Transformation Strategy](https://www.dta.gov.au/digital-transformation-strategy/digital-transformation-strategy-refresh),
we looked back and explored how this disruption highlighted 3 key insights:

<div class="max-42 mt-1">
<ul>
<li> the importance of centralised information, especially during a crisis</li>
<li>once people understand the issue, there is an ongoing need for local
  information and services</li>
<li>crisis communications channels should be optimised for mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
</div>

This case study focuses on how the community used the government’s coronavirus
communications channels, Australia.gov.au, the WhatsApp chatbot and the
Coronavirus Australia information app. These channels were mobilised earlier
this year as a response to the community’s need for centralised, clear
communication.

## Australia.gov.au – the Coronavirus one-stop shop

In March 2020, the DTA repurposed
[Australia.gov.au](https://australia.gov.au/)’s homepage to become a ‘one-stop
shop’ for Commonwealth and State and Territory Coronavirus information and
support services. To improve the site’s reach, the DTA worked with major tech
companies to list the site as the authoritative place for Australian Government
information. This action helped to drive 43% visits to the site during the year
from search and social media.

Late March saw a rapid increase in Coronavirus cases in Australia and the
introduction of travel restrictions. It also brought the first of a series large
traffic surges to Australia.gov.au. The DTA also released the Coronavirus
Australia information app and a WhatsApp chatbot, providing additional
communication channels for Australians to use. To advertise these channels, the
DTA worked with telecommunications providers to send SMS messages to all mobile
users on 4 May, attracting over 975,000 people to the site.

In March and April, most Australia.gov.au visitors were new to the site, and the
following months showed an increase of returning users. Though our main traffic
source is normally organic search, during the pandemic over 40% of visitors came
to the site either by typing in the address or using a bookmark. This is most
likely due to the site’s easy to remember address, and details appearing on
press banners during press conferences.

Search engines like Google and Bing still brought in around 29% of the site’s
traffic. Another major source of traffic has been referrals from other
government websites. Commonwealth agencies have added a link on their home pages
to Australia.gov.au. and these links have accounted for just over 22% of our
sites traffic.

## Australia.gov.au a quick route to local information

Traffic from Australia.gov.au to States and Territories sites has been
consistent through the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, we saw
significant traffic going from our site to other Commonwealth sites. As people
understood the virus and the various Commonwealth services, the community’s
focus shifted to wanting to know the critical information for where they lived.

As States and Territories differed on restrictions and support services, people
preferred information that was specific to them. Even during the Victorian
lockdown, most of the site’s traffic flowed through to state and territory
sites. The Coronavirus App and WhatsApp chatbot also saw almost 60% of traffic
flowing through to State and Territory sites.

## The importance of mobile technology during a crisis

Mobile users dominated the sites during peak traffic periods. While this traffic
increase could be attribute to the range of mobile friendly coronavirus services
developed, we saw a similar increase across other gov.au sites from mobile
devices. The key lesson from this behaviour is to make sure crisis
communications and services are optimised for mobile devices. The Coronavirus
Australia App and WhatsApp Chatbot exemplified this requirement. Built primarily
for mobile devices, these services provided easy access to preconfigured
information and links to Commonwealth, State and Territory services.

The Coronavirus WhatsApp chatbot continues to respond to over 1000 messages per
day. By providing different ways of accessing information, users have been able
to stay informed in a way they are comfortable with. The positive response to
this service shows the power of mobile technology to reach more people.

## What does it mean and what should we do next?

Australia.gov.au’s main user type was smartphone users across the country, who
returned regularly seeking localised information. They also knew the site’s
address or had it bookmarked. We noted the following:

<div class="max-42 mt-1">
  <ul>
    <li>with a perceived user need for a ‘one-stop shop’, Australia.gov.au could
  fulfill that purpose</li>
    <li>as our users understood the virus and Commonwealth support, they used the site
  to find State and Territory content
      <ul>
        <li>the value of localised, personalised content and information should be a key
      consideration when planning crisis responses</li>
        <li>content is best coordinated across jurisdictions to avoid duplication of
      information or competition for users</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>in times of crisis, people rely on mobile phones to access information.
    Mobile-responsive content is critical and should be well maintained</li>
    <li>WhatsApp, the Coronavirus Australia App and SMS communications, meant a
    broader range of mobile users engaged with our content</li>
    <li>further research into the user experience would help agencies discover what
    role they played for people, and help further personalise responses for crisis
    events.</li>
  </ul>
