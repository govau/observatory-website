## We've added a new tool called Optimize 360

To help gov.au Observatory subscribers meet changing user expectations, we have
added Google Optimize 360 to our service.
<a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/" target="_blank">Optimize
360</a> is the premium version of Google’s website testing and personlisation
product. It's an optimisation tool that can test different website elements and
create personalized experiences for specific user needs.

Out of the box it integrates easily with Google Tag Manager, Analytics and
Firebase. This allows you to use the data to create specific user cohorts and
capture test data.

Using the
<a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/" target="_blank">Optimize
editor</a> you can change the color of a button or move important content higher
up the page. As your confidence grows you can move from simple A/B testing to
full multivariate testing. Once you have validated your testing hypotheses, you
can use the editor to deploy these changes as targeted personalisations.

## Better website testing

As you review your web analytics, you may start to identify parts of your
service that need improving. Building on this evidence, you will create
hypotheses that a change may improve your users’ experience. But how will you
know if the changes work?

Starting with
<a href="https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/7012154#ab-tests" target="_blank">A/B
testing</a> you can create a simple experiment that compares the original
website (A) with a variant (B/C/D/…). Optimize allows you to choose how often
variations appear and who sees the variations. Audience segments can be based on
what device they use, where they came from, or how they were referred to your
service. Alternatively you can create
<a href="https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/7012154#redirect-tests" target="_blank">redirect
tests</a> that allows you to test 2 totally different pages.

As your hypotheses mature, you can expand your test to include
<a href="https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/7012154#multivariate-tests" target="_blank">multivariate
experiments</a>. These more complex experiments allow you to test 2 or more
elements of your website simultaneously. Rather than seeing which variant is
most effective, the multivariate testing lets you identify the most effective
element type and the best combination to present them in.

## Website Personalisation

When you have identified new features and designs through testing, you can use
website personalisation to offer a specific service to tailored user cohorts.
You can also tailor your site to reinforce an agency campaign, such as support
for rural and regional Australians. As users access your service through various
calls to action, such as an email, news elements can be added to your service to
emphasise the campaign’s call to action.

## How do I get started?

Contact us (the Observatory team) at
<a href="mailto:observatory@dta.gov.au">observatory@dta.gov.au</a> to enable
Optimize 360 for your services. We are providing this service at no additional
cost for the remainder of the year, to see if there is sufficient demand to keep
it as a permanent feature.

We are looking to run free training on how to make the most out of Optimize 360.
