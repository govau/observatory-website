## Research Roadmap

Right now the Observatory is focusing on

- understanding the intent, behaviour and outcomes of our users as they navigate
  specific life events
- understanding how the community's engagement with .gov.au has changed during
  the Coronavirus pandemic.

How people access government services

<p>
This graph represents two weeks of user traffic across 38 .gov.au websites. 
The bottom and left hand side visualises search engine traffic from Google and Bing,
predominately showing users visiting a single page then leaving. The graph
middle visualises webpages drawing traffic from across the search environment
along with traffic from people using bookmarks.

The top of the graph visualises traffic transiting around the
humanservices.gov.au domain. Node size and colour represent the Eigenvector
measure for the page in relation to all other nodes in the graph. Eigenvector
centrality measures the importance of webpages in the graph. Webpages with a
high Eigenvector are connected to other pages that are also important. Google’s
PageRank algorithm is a variant of Eigenvector Centrality

How government has built their services

<p>
This was created using website links from the DTA's Australian Government Web
Crawl Dataset on data.gov.au. It shows domain-to-domain connections with more
than 1250 links between them. Isolated domains (those without any links) have
been removed. Node size and colour reflect their importance and influence;
larger and darker nodes are those that have more connections to others. Graph
layout uses the Yifan Hu proportional algorithm and was generated using the
Gephi software package

Visual Analysis of webpages per Portfolio

<p>
This ‘Nightingale diagram’ provides a birds-eye view of over 9M URLs gathered
from the Australian Government webcawl in May 2019, hosted on data.gov.au The 19
Sectors of this graph are divided into portfolios, all containing multiple
agencies and websites. The multiple colours of each portfolio represent
different webpages.

The inner, middle and outer rings refer to volume of websites for each portfolio
contained in the webcrawl dataset. On the left is a close up of the apex,
showing the smallest minority of webpages per portfolio.

Named after English social reformer, nurse and statistician Florence Nightingale
she was seen a pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics, through
her works as a nurse in the Crimean War.
