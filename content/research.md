## Best Practice

How might I best use website analytics

I want to:

- Integrate Google Analytics and search console
- Get the best out of Big Query and Google Tag Manager
- Creating an analytics strategy (another spot for the WAGA)
- Ensure the privacy of my visitors while knowing using demographic data
- Training documentation

## Research Roadmap

Right now the Observatory is focusing on

- understanding the intent, behaviour and outcomes of our users as they navigate
  specific life events
- understanding how the community's engagement with .gov.au has changed during
  the Coronavirus pandemic.
