## Research roadmap

The Observatory team performs research using the anonymous analytics data
created as people use government services.

Here we describe the research outcomes that we hope to achieve.

**Now**

- understanding the intent, behaviour and outcomes of users as they navigate
  specific life events
- understanding how the community's engagement with .gov.au has changed during
  the Coronavirus pandemic

## Product roadmap

The Observatory team regularly conducts research to understand our user needs.
That research informs development of the Observatory.

This roadmap shows stories that are in our backlog for design and development.

**Now**

- Observatory website - observatory.service.gov.au
- Reports - How do analysts receive and respond to incoming requests for data
  analysis?

**Next**

- New training schedule
- Additional data sources for reporting
- Case studies of web analytics improving services

**Later**

- Community space - Connect with and learn from other data analysts across
  government
- Feedback form - Install this on your website to understand how successful a
  person's journey was
- Monthly showcases - Show off analytics implementations, outcomes and learnings
  from across government
- New Observatory pricing structure - Reducing costs for teams to make use of
  the Observatory

## Publications

### [Discovery Report](/gov-au-observatory_discovery_research_findings-report.pdf)

**How our subscribers use our service**

High-level insights from a Discovery research stage with Australian Public
Service data analysts and practitioners.

This research shows what we learned about how analysts work, their challenges,
changes they would like to see, and how the Observatory might help achieve those
changes.

### [Functional Behaviour diagram](/gov-au_observatory-funtional-behaviour.pdf)

**How people access government services**

This graph represents two weeks of user traffic across 38 .gov.au websites. The
bottom and left hand side visualises search engine traffic from Google and Bing,
predominantly showing users visiting a single page then leaving. The graph
middle visualises webpages drawing traffic from across the search environment
along with traffic from people using bookmarks.

The top of the graph visualises traffic transiting around the
humanservices.gov.au domain. Node size and colour represent the Eigenvector
measure for the page in relation to all other nodes in the graph. Eigenvector
centrality measures the importance of webpages in the graph. Webpages with a
high Eigenvector are connected to other pages that are also important. Google’s
PageRank algorithm is a variant of Eigenvector Centrality.

### [Structural Behaviour diagram](/gov-au_observatory-structural-behaviour.pdf)

**How government connects services**

This was created using website links from the DTA's
[Australian Government Web Crawl dataset](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-99f43557-1d3d-40e7-bc0c-665a4275d625/details).
It shows domain-to-domain connections with more than 1250 links between them.
Isolated domains (those without any links) have been removed. Node size and
colour reflect their importance and influence; larger and darker nodes are those
that have more connections to others. Graph layout uses the Yifan Hu
proportional algorithm and was generated using the Gephi software package.

### [Sunburst Diagram](../../gov-au-observatory_webcrawl-sunburst.pdf)

**Visual Analysis of webpages per Portfolio**

This ‘Nightingale diagram’ provides a birds-eye view of over 9 million URLs
gathered from the
[Australian Government Web Crawl dataset](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-99f43557-1d3d-40e7-bc0c-665a4275d625/details).
The 19 sectors of this graph are divided into portfolios, all containing
multiple agencies and websites. The multiple colours of each portfolio represent
different websites.

The inner, middle and outer rings refer to volume of websites for each portfolio
contained in the webcrawl dataset. On the left is a close up of the apex,
showing the smallest minority of webpages per portfolio.

### [Understanding Common Pain Points using Google Analytics Report](../../understanding-the-common-pain-points-using-web-analytics)

A common pain point people face when interacting with government is difficulty
finding the information they need. The DTA’s
[GovX](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/govx) and
[.gov.au Observatory](https://observatory.service.gov.au) teams collaborated to
explore how web analytics data can help us to better understand this pain point.
