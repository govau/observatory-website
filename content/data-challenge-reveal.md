#### Context:

This graph was generated by aggregating 508 government services' web analytics
and is from our
prototype:[Technology Demographic Dashboard](analytics.service.gov.au).

Often in analytics we talk about user demographic so we experimented with the
concept of building a technology demographic view of users accessing government
websites compised of Google Analytics data from our subscribers.
