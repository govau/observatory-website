#### Context:

This graph was generated by aggregating the web analytics of 508 government
services who are subscribed to our Google Analytics 360 and is from our
prototype [Technology Demographic Dashboard](analytics.service.gov.au).

Often in analytics we talk about user demographics so we experimented with the
concept of visualising technology demographics of users accessing government
websites.
