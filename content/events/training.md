title: Digital Constellations from user journeys
type: event
description: ‘Can we use data to understand how people are using government services delivered across different government websites?’ This was the simple question leading to the creation of the gov.au Observatory, and a new stream of quantitative research. It supports our other well-established research methods to help government build the services users need.
