## About this Event

**Registration closes:** Monday 12 July 2021, AEDT 11:59 pm

You will need:

- A Computer or Laptop, with a working webcam (it really helps our trainers if
  your camera stays on!)
- Access to a Google Analytics account, with your organisation’s property data.
- Access to Google Analytics, Tag manager, Data studio and Zoom before training.

Due to the current social distancing restrictions we are delivering training
online via Zoom.

### Learning Outcomes

Continuing our popular Google Analytics for Government training, we’ve
re-designed the curriculum with a greater focus on how analytics can help you
measure and understand your service using the Digital Service Standard stages
(i.e. Discovery, Alpha, Beta, and Live).

Syllabus and learning outcomes are based on the
[Web Analytics Guide](https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/google-analytics-government/web-analytics-agile).
