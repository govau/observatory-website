## About this Event

Registration closes : Monday 17th August

You will need:

A Computer or Laptop, with a working webcam (it really helps our trainers if
your camera stays on!) Access to a Google Analytics account, with your
organisation’s property data. Access to Google Analytics, Tag manager, Data
studio and Zoom before training. Due to the current social distancing
restrictions we are delivering training online via Zoom. Spaces are limited as
we are trialling this format for the first time.

### Learning Outcomes

Continuing our popular Google Analytics for Government training, we’ve
re-designed the curriculum with a greater focus on how analytics can help you
measure and understand your service using the Digital Service Standard stages
(i.e. Discovery, Alpha, Beta, and Live).

Syllabus and learning outcomes are based on the Web Analytics Guide:
