# Terms of service

Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google makes Google Analytics free of charge up to a maximum of 10 million Hits per month per account. Google also offers a premium version of Google Analytics called Google Analytics 360 Suite.

Google licenses Google Analytics 360 Suite through resellers called Sales Partners. The Commonwealth represented by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) has entered into an agreement with one of Google’s Sales Partners, Data Runs Deep Pty Ltd (Sales Partner), for licensing and support of Google Analytics 360 Suite to the Commonwealth.

The purpose of these DTA Terms of Service is to set out the terms on which Commonwealth agencies can subscribe for Google Analytics 360 Suite via the DTA (Subscription Service). They are not legally binding.

## Who can subscribe?

References in these DTA Terms of Service to your agency are to a Commonwealth Department or agency that has opted to subscribe.

Your agency can move its subscription to another agency that is also legally part of the Commonwealth by notifying the DTA Contact Officer (see below). At this stage, the Subscription Service is not open to State, Territory or local government bodies.

## What are the terms of this licence?

Google owns the intellectual property in Google Analytics and any system, product, service or material used/provided in relation to Analytics Services.

This means that your agency’s use of the Google Analytics is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the [Google Analytics Terms of Service](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html).

Account and Property have the same meaning as in the Google Analytics Terms of Service.

## How does onboarding work?

The DTA will:

- onboard your agency to the Google Analytics 360 Suite service, including upgrading your agency’s Google Analytics Account to 360 status.
- onboard your Google Analytics Account to the DTA’s data analysis environment [(why do you need this?)](#data-confidential):
  - Google BigQuery
  - Google Search Console

Your agency needs to:

- create and implement Analytics Properties on your agency’s web services
- ensure that the ‘DTA - Analytics’ user group has Read & Analyze access to the subscribed Analytics Properties
- ensure that IP Masking is enabled on your Analytics Properties

## What service levels apply?

The Google Analytics 360 Suite is provided by Google. Google undertakes to use commercially reasonable efforts to [meet the service levels](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/ga360suite/sla.html).

If there is an issue with the Google Analytics platform, your agency should notify the DTA of the issue.

## What support does the DTA provide?

The DTA will provide your agency with Level 1 support for the Google Analytics 360 Suite service. This support is available 9am-5pm Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays in the ACT. To lodge a support request, please email analytics@digital.gov.au. All support is subject to DTA resourcing constraints.

The DTA has contracted its Sales Partner to provide a limited amount of additional support for Google Analytics issues that the DTA is unable to resolve. Any additional support may only be requested by the DTA. DTA may decline to request additional support.

If an issue needs to be investigated by the DTA or its Sales Partner, your agency may need to grant access to your agency’s Properties to the Sales Partner in order to receive support.

## What training does the DTA provide?

The DTA holds regular (approximately monthly) training sessions covering Google Analytics 360 Suite products and topics of interest. The sessions are presented by Google Analytics Certified professionals.

Representatives of your agency can attend the training in person (at the DTA’s 50 Marcus Clarke Street offices) or online.

The DTA aims to publish details of training sessions at least one month in advance. Tickets for [training events are provided via Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/o/digital-transformation-agency-8025584572).

While your agency subscribes to the Subscription Service, the DTA will:

- provide your agency representative with separate notice of all training events
- not charge your agency representatives to attend.

## Who controls user access?

Your agency continues to be responsible for setting user access controls for your agency’s Account and Properties.

As Organisation administrator, the DTA will have access to modify user access to your Accounts. However, it will not do so unless directed or agreed by your agency, or as otherwise required by these DTA Terms of Service.

## Who is responsible for privacy?

Your agency continues to be responsible for ensuring that its officers, employees, agents and subcontractors comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and your agency’s other obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

You should be aware that Google Analytics data is processed and stored in the United States of America.

It is a requirement of the Google Analytics Terms of Service that your agency:

- does not “pass information to Google that Google could use or recognize as personally identifiable information”
- alerts users that cookies are used to collect data
- discloses the use of Google Analytics, and how it collects and processes data.

## Is agency data confidential?

In order to subscribe, your agency must give the DTA read-only access to your agency’s Properties. This read-only access will only be granted to select DTA employees and will be used for internal DTA analysis to

- assist your agency in improving their online services where, and if, required
- improve or refine training to your agency’s staff
- continue the DTA’s commitment to assist all government agencies in creating and maintaining online services that are simple, clear and fast.

The DTA uses its data analysis environment to develop strategic insights about the .gov.au domain. The DTA will share these insights with agencies to assist them in improving their digital environment and service delivery.

The DTA may also disclose information collected from your agency with third parties without your consent:

- for purposes relating to these terms of service
- where authorised or required by law
- for government or parliamentary accountability purposes.

You should also be aware that the Google Analytics Terms of Service give Google the right to share your agency’s confidential information with third parties without your agency’s consent in particular circumstances. For further details see the Google Analytics Terms of Service.

## What fees are payable?

DTA pays fees to its Sales Partner based on the number of Billable Hits per month aggregated across all of your agencies subscribed properties. [Hit is defined by Google](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6086082).

The DTA invoices agencies that subscribe annually in advance. Invoices are payable within 30 days.

Fees are calculated on a cost recovery basis in accordance with the following table.

</div>

The DTA reviews the fees annually with an intent to reduce costs to agencies that subscribe.

The DTA will use the Billable Hit Volume presented in your agency’s Google 360 Suite Administration console to estimate the appropriate pricing tier for your agency.

## How does unsubscribing work?

Your agency can unsubscribe at any time and for any reason by providing 30 days’ notice to the Contact Officer (see below).

If your agency unsubscribes:

your agency’s Analytics Properties will be downgraded from Google Analytics 360 to standard Google Analytics
you may choose to remain part of the Commonwealth of Australia Google Analytics Organisation, or separate
generally, the DTA will not provide reimbursement to your agency for any fees paid in advance
The DTA may also downgrade your agency’s access if an invoice issued to your agency is overdue by more than 60 days.

The [implications of downgrading](https://support.google.com/marketingplatform/answer/9013959?hl=en) are summarised.

## What happens if there is a change in Sales Partner?

Changes to the Sales Partner are not expected to impact on the availability of the Subscription Service or your agency’s access to Google Analytics 360 Suite products.

If the agreement between the DTA and the Sales Partner expires or is terminated the DTA may:

- transfer the Subscription Service to a new Sales Partner appointed by the DTA
- transfer the Subscription Service to a new Sales Partner nominated by your agency
- downgrade your Account.

## What happens if the Subscription Service is terminated?

The DTA can terminate the Subscription Service at any time and for any reason by providing 30 days’ notice to your agency’s technical representative.

If the DTA terminates the Subscription Service, the DTA will work cooperatively with your agency to:

offboard your agency
ensure that your agency’s Accounts and Properties can be separated from the Commonwealth of Australia Google Analytics Organisation
migrate your Accounts and Properties to your agency or another Sales Partner nominated by your agency.
