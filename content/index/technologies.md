The gov.au Observatory exists to empower data practitioners to improve government services.

## Who are we?
The gov.au Observatory, a team from the Digital Transformation Agency. 

## What we do
We use data science to learn how people interact with government. We create and share insights from a unified view of government services. We provide training, tools and advice to help analysts make sense of how people use their services. 

We do all of this without identifying people, or creating identifiable information about people.
