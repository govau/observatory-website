## Welcome!

<p class = "intro">The gov.au Observatory provides a range of data products, tools, resources and practitioner community events to help bring informed, evidence-based decision making to the heart of APS agencies.</p>

We use data science to learn how people interact with government services. We create and share insights from a unified view of government services. We provide training, tools and advice to help analysts make sense of how people use their services.

We do all of this without identifying people, or creating identifiable information about people.
