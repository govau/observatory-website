# Google Analytics 360

## Before you start

**To sign up you will need**

- To work for a federal government agency, Commonwealth entity or company listed
  on the
  [PGPA Flipchart](https://www.finance.gov.au/government/managing-commonwealth-resources/structure-australian-government-public-sector/pgpa-act-flipchart-list)
- A Google Analytics Account, paid or free-to-use. We use this as a base to
  upgrade your access.
- Approval from an Executive Level 1 delegation or higher.

## Steps

### 1. Complete form

Once you have decided if
[Google Analytics 360 is right for you](/google-analytics-360/features), fill
out our sign up form. Make sure you have read the
[terms of service](/google-analytics-360/terms-of-service).

<div className="mt-1">
  <Link to="/google-analytics-360/sign-up" className="au-btn">
    Sign up for Google Analytics 360
  </Link>
</div>

### 2. We'll respond

Our team will confirm your agency’s eligibility and send you an email response
within 24 hours to explain how to pay for the service, as well as some useful
resources you can explore while we’re setting things up for you.

If we need to help you set up your accounts from scratch, that can take a little
longer (around 3 business days).

### 3. Connected

Once connected you’ll be able to access a variety of Google Analytics tools
straight away. You’ll also have access to the Observatory and our
whole-of-government data insights.
